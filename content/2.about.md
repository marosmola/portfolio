# About

Hi, I'm Marek, a 25-year-old software enginner from Slovakia. With over 5 years of experience in software development, I'm passionate about crafting innovative solutions and diving into the world of DevOps.

Beyond coding, I'm a sports enthusiast, I love windsurfing. This blog is my space to share insights into the tech landscape and my adventures in the world of winds and waves.

Let's explore the intersections of code and wind together! ðŸš€ðŸŒŠ
